# Welcome to Lambda School's Installation Guide for your Linux operating system
- You are welcome to use whichever Linux OS you are comfortable with.
- These instructions have been tested with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
- These instructions should be applicable to any Debian based Linux system (e.g. Arch, Mint, _et cetera_)
- Suggestion: pin apps to taskbar (Ubuntu equivalent name?)

<!-- # Integrating Git Bash into Atom & VSC IDE
### VSC
- Setting up VSC to use Git Bash on Windows
- https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal
NOTE: maybe overkill to set it up with both? maybe worth documenting and hiding?

<details><summary>Expand if you want BOTH bash and PowerShell available in VSC</summary><p>

- hacky workaround to have both bash and Powershell available in the VSC terminal selector: http://jeffa.tech/vscode-multiple-integrated-terminals/
1. `ctrl + comma` will load your user settings in VSC
2. Modify your User Settings:
```js
// Place your settings in this file to overwrite the default settings
{
    // Git Bash
    "terminal.integrated.shell.windows": "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe",
    // PowerShell
    "terminal.integrated.shell.windows2": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe"
}
```

3. ``ctrl + tilda/backtick (~/`)`` to open editor. It should say `1. bash`
4. add the `2` t the end of the bash key and remove it from the powershell key, like so:
```js
// Place your settings in this file to overwrite the default settings
{
    // Git Bash
    "terminal.integrated.shell.windows2": "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe",
    // PowerShell
    "terminal.integrated.shell.windows": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe"
}

```

5. now press the plus sign to create a new terminal. It should say `2. powershell`
6. now swap the `2` back to how it looked in step 2.
7. Now any new consoles you create will be bash, but you'll have a persistent option 1 & 2.

</p></details>

### Atom
- Setting up Atom with an integrated console: https://atom.io/packages/platformio-ide-terminal (PowerShell is the default)
1. `ctrl + ,` for settings
2. select `+ Install`
3. 3. type in `platformio-ide-terminal`
4. Install the platformio-ide-terminal package!
5. ``ctrl + tilda/backtick (~/`)`` to launch a new terminal in Atom.
6. `alt + shift + t` to make a new console
7. `alt + shift + j/k` to cycle through them

- Setting up Atom for an integrated console using your Git Bash: https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/bash-on-ubuntu-on-windows-on-atom/44948
- NOTE: the article says to set to: `C:\\Windows\\sysnative\\bash.exe`
- but I set the Shell Override to: `C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\bash.exe` for it to work.
- if neither work, in Git Bash console, ascertain which bash.exe file you are using with this command:
- `$ which bash`
- and use the Windows syntax for the absolute path `which bash` displays, i.e. `C:\path to bash.exe`.
- once you know the path, you can open the parent folder if you want to see the actual bash.exe.
- In Git Bash, enter `open $(dirname $(which bash))`.
- Then you can see the full Windows syntax pathname in the Windows Explorer bar. -->
