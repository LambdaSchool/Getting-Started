    * Just GitBash or the tools for PShell/CMD? See also: http://www.jamessturtevant.com/posts/5-Ways-to-install-git-on-Windows/

8. Install a Text Editor ([Atom](https://atom.io/), [VSC](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), vim (comes w/git bash iirc), Sublime(nagware), Brackets, et cetera.)
9. Install [Zoom](https://zoom.us/download).
    - You may also want the plugin for Outlook or the Extension for the Chrome browser (scroll down on the Downloads page).

# other things?
- Package manager like [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)?
- `telnet` (afaik, not a part of win10 release) https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/38433.windows-10-enabling-telnet-client.aspx see also: http://www.sysprobs.com/install-and-enable-telnet-in-windows-8-use-as-telnet-client
- `curl` is asking for the IE engine? https://youtu.be/qlTVMuONazs. Seems to be part of GitBash.
- PostMan
- Expo XDE (React-Native)
- `ngrok`
- Firefox & Opera?

# Integrating Git Bash into Atom & VSC IDE
### VSC
- Setting up VSC to use Git Bash on Windows
- https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal
NOTE: maybe overkill to set it up with both? maybe worth documenting and hiding?

<details><summary>Expand if you want BOTH bash and PowerShell available in VSC</summary><p>

- hacky workaround to have both bash and Powershell available in the VSC terminal selector: http://jeffa.tech/vscode-multiple-integrated-terminals/
1. `ctrl + comma` will load your user settings in VSC
2. Modify your User Settings:
    ```js
    // Place your settings in this file to overwrite the default settings
    {
        // Git Bash
        "terminal.integrated.shell.windows": "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe",
        // PowerShell
        "terminal.integrated.shell.windows2": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe"
    }
    ```

3. ``ctrl + tilda/backtick (~/`)`` to open editor. It should say `1. bash`
4. add the `2` t the end of the bash key and remove it from the powershell key, like so:
    ```js
    // Place your settings in this file to overwrite the default settings
    {
        // Git Bash
        "terminal.integrated.shell.windows2": "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe",
        // PowerShell
        "terminal.integrated.shell.windows": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe"
    }
    ```

5. now press the plus sign to create a new terminal. It should say `2. powershell`
6. now swap the `2` back to how it looked in step 2.
7. Now any new consoles you create will be bash, but you'll have a persistent option 1 & 2.

</p></details>

### Atom
- Setting up Atom with an integrated console: https://atom.io/packages/platformio-ide-terminal (PowerShell is the default)
1. `ctrl + ,` for settings
2. select `+ Install`
3. 3. type in `platformio-ide-terminal`
4. Install the platformio-ide-terminal package!
5. ``ctrl + tilda/backtick (~/`)`` to launch a new terminal in Atom.
6. `alt + shift + t` to make a new console
7. `alt + shift + j/k` to cycle through them

- Set the Shell Override to: `C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\bash.exe` for it to work.
- if this doesn't work, in the Git Bash console, ascertain which bash.exe file you are using with this command:
- `$ which bash`
- and use the Windows syntax for the absolute path `which bash` displays, i.e. `C:\path to bash.exe`.
